What is typescript?
:- It is called a strongly typed superset of javascript.
typescript is a strongly typed language.
typescript first converted into javascript by typescript compiler then goes to the browser.
:- TypeScript is a language that adds types to JavaScript, which allows developers to catch errors at compile-time 
rather than runtime, and helps improve code maintainability, readability, and 
scalability.

Here are some key features of TypeScript:
1. Static typing: TypeScript allows you to specify types for variables, functions, 
and other constructs in your code, which are then checked by the TypeScript compiler.
This helps catch errors before runtime and improves code readability.

2. Object-oriented programming: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming (OOP)
concepts such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism. This makes it 
easier to build complex applications and maintain them over time.

3. Compiler: TypeScript comes with a compiler that converts TypeScript code into 
JavaScript code, which can then be run in any modern browser or server environment.

install typescript compiler:- sudo apt install node-typescript
---------------------
Variables and Datatype:-

javascript has var and let to declare a variable and const to declare a constant,It is same in typescript as well.
But,In typescript we have choice to explicitly decide the Datatype.


Primitive Datatype:- number
Syntax:- let <variableName> : <Datatype> =value
eg:-
let a : number=9;
let b:number=0.145
console.log(a,b) //9,  0.145 

-------------------
Primitive Datatype:- Boolean(true,false)
eg:-
let a:boolean=true;
let b:boolean=false;
console.log(a) //true
console.log(b) //false
console.log(typeof a) //"boolean"
console.log(typeof b) //"boolean"

---------------------
Primitive Datatype:- undefined,null,void
eg:-
let a:number;
console.log(a) //undefined 
console.log(typeof a) //"undefined" 
let c=null 
console.log(c) //null
let b:number=null
console.log(b) //null

function sum(a:number,b:number):number{  //it will return number
    return a+b;
}

function sum(a:number,b:number):void{ //it will return void means nothing
    return a+b;
}
------------------------
Primitive Datatype:- any
:-any is one datatype in typescript which can hold any type of value.If we don't specify the type,it will be considered as 'any'
eg:-
let a:any;
QUes:-when do you think "any" type is useful?
:- when we don't know which type of value will be assigned to a variable in future.

--------------
Type Annotation and Inference:-
eg:-
let const <variable>:<datatype>=value;
here,the datatype given after a colon(:) sign is basically the type Annotation.

Note:- when there is no explicit type Annotation,typescript compiler assumes the type according to assigned value.
eg:-
let a=10;
console.log(typeof a) //"number"
let b="test"
console.log(typeof b) //"string"

Note:- Typescript Inference:- Typescript assumes the type of depending on the assigned value

--------------------------
Function scope vs Block scope:-
:-scope of a variable can be local or global
:-Global variable will be accessible for all functions.

es5 has hoisting bcoz of var but in es6 we don't have hoisting bcoz of block scope

----------------------
String:-
Typescript does not have a single character datatype .
String is a separate datatype but can be used for a single character or multiple character.
we can declare a variable as a string with the help of "",'' or ``.

--------------------
Type Aliases:-
It is possible to define your own datatype in typescript.
we use "type" keyword.
eg:-
type Address={
    Street:string,
    City:string,
    Pin:number
}
function showData(obj:Address){
    console.log(obj.Street,obj.City,obj.Pin);  //"Gandhi MAidan",  "Jehanabad",  804407 
}
showData({Street:'Gandhi MAidan',City:'Jehanabad',Pin:804407})


------------------------
"never" type:-
Those type of function which doesn't return anything,we can set "never" as  a return type.
Note:- Generally a function not returning anything can be defined as "void" but still returns undefined.
But,if you have "never" data type it will give "compile time error".

Note:-we can assign null or undefined to "void" type but we can't do the same with "never" type.
eg:-
let x:void=undefined;
let y:never=undefined //it will give error  //Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'never'.

----------------------------03 Typescript Compiler& Project Configuration-----------------------
---Watch Mode:-
tsc compiler hmare code ko .js me convert kr deta hai lekin us .ts me hum chnage krte hai to hame again se tsc app.ts krna pdega
iske liye hm watch mode ka use kr skte hai
eg:- tsc app.ts -w

Watch mode has a limitation that :it wtaches the individual file only:-

So let's learn how to make it watch for entire project:-
tsc --init :-like npm init ,this generates a .json file (tsconfig.json file),it initiates the project
tsconfig.json file contains various compiler options

now, type only tsc -w(isse sabhi file watch mode me chlega)

we can set include,exclude in tsconfig file for our project.

-----------------------------
Setting the Compilation target:-

:- "target" option basically decides that the code converted by Typescript compiler should be in which version of javascript.

--------------------
Setting Modules:-
To implement Modules,import & export statements are used.
eg:-
import {sum,sub} from './calc

when we changed the module to "CommonJS" in config file,then our code is generated with Object.defineProperty(exports,"__esModule",)
CommonJS is used when Nod.js related coding is to be generated.



--------------------Array and Tuple----------------------------------------------
Array BAsics:-
In JS,when we declare an array ,it can store any type of value but In typescript,it has to be the similar type only.
eg:-
let a:number[]=[10,3,45,98];
console.log(a); //[10, 3, 45, 98]

:-Use [] when you know that array value will be assigned at a later stage.
eg:-
let a:number[]:[];
a[0]=5;
a[1]=45;

-------------Tuple Basics---------
:- Tuple is another useful data structure which is like an array but can store any type of data.
:- A Tuple can limit fixed number of elements along with the data type.
eg:-
let person:[string,boolean]=["Kamdev",true];


--------Union type-----------
when we want that a variable should be able to handle 2 or more types,then we can use "|"(Union type)
eg:-
let a:number|string|boolean;

----------Array MAnipulation-----------
Adding & removing elements in an array:-
:-There are 4 most known methods to add or remove elements:-
push(),pop(),shift(),unshift()
push&unshift are used to add elements.

see in javascript

---------2d array----------
let arr:number[][]=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
console.log(arr);

-----------------------------FUNCTIONS-----------------------------
function sum(a:number,b:number){
    return a+b;
}
let ans=sum(5,6);
console.log(ans) //11


function test(){
    console.log("TEST"); //"TEST"
}
let a=test();  
console.log(a);  //undefined


-------Anonymous Function or function expression------
let sum=function(a:number,b:number){
    return a+b;
}
console.log(sum(5,6)); //11

--------REST OPERATOR---------
in typescript,rest parameter must be of an array type.
function test(a:number,...b:number[]){
     console.log(a); //1
     console.log(b); //[3, 5, 4, 9, 75] 
}
test(1,3,5,4,9,75)

--------------------------------ENUM-------------------------------
Enum type:-
Enumeration is a feature which allows you to define named constants.
Enum is a collection of fixed values where numbers are automatically assigned.
In typescript,we have numeric,string & heterogeneous enums.we use enum keyword to define enumeration.
eg:-
enum WorkDAys{
     MON,TUE,WED,THURS,FRI,SAT,SUN
}
console.log(WorkDAys)   //{ "0": "MON", "1": "TUE", "2": "WED", "3": "THURS", "4": "FRI","5": "SAT", "6": "SUN","MON": 0, "TUE": 1, "WED": 2, "THURS": 3, "FRI": 4, "SAT": 5, "SUN": 6}
console.log(WorkDAys.MON)  //0
console.log(WorkDAys.WED) //2

Note:-
when we declare enum values with any number,the rest are incremented automatically.
eg:-
MON=2 then, tue will be 3.

also,we can declare string in enum.
enum WorkDAys{
    MOn=1,
    TUE="TUESDAY"
}

---------------------
Reverse Mapping:-
It helps us to get the numeric value from the member or vice-versa.
eg:-
enum WorkDAys{
     MON,TUE,WED,THURS,FRI,SAT,SUN
}
console.log(WorkDAys.WED)  //2
console.log(WorkDAys["WED"]) //2

NOTE:- String enum members do not get a reverse mapping generated at all.

-----------------
Const enum:- To avoid unnecessary enum coding in your javascript file,we can make enum as const.(not advisable)
ambient enum:- The enum declared using declare keyword itself means that is already existing and is currently used as a reference ,known as ambient enum.


--------------------------------------Object Oriented Typescript------------------------------


















-------------------------------------Interface-------------------------------
with the help of interface,we can create custom variables.
eg:-
interface Address{
    address1:string,
    street:string,
    pin:number,
}
let home:Address;
home={
    address1:'Jehanabad',
    street:'Gandhi MAidan',
    pin:804407
}
Note:- Interface declaration decides the structure of the object literal & therefore it is known as "Object Types" in newer Typescript

-------
To apply an interface on a class, implements keyword is used.
eg:-
interface Vehicle{
    vId:number,
    vName:string,
}
class Car implements Vehicle{  //it means the class can have its own members or properties apart from those in the interface.

}

-----------
How will you inherit an interface?
:- by using extends keyword

-----------------------------
Generics:-
Typescript's generic feature is used to develop reusable components.
Generics allows components to work with any data type instead of restricting to one data type only.
Generics can be used in many ways like Generic interfaces,Generic Classes etc.
