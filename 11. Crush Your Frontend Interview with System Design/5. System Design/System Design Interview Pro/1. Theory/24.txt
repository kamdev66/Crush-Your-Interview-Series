What are Database Indexes?

:- Database indexing is a technique used to improve the performance of database queries by creating data structures (indexes) that allow for efficient retrieval of data based on certain criteria. 

:- jab hum indexing ka use krte hai to us column ke liye ek
separate memory allocate ho jati hai,jisme wo column ke elements
sorted order me honge. aur isme jo value hoga wo original col ke 
value ko point krega.

:- O(logn ) complexity me search krega qki ye sorted hai

:- Indexing creates a lookup table with the column and the pointer
to the memory location of the row,containing this column.

:- B-trees data structure is used to store the indexing as
it is a multilevel format of tree-based indexing,which has balanced
binary trees.

:- read queries bahot jyada aa rhi hai wahi pr hame indexing lgani hai.
