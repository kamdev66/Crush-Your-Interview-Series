18. what is lamport logical clock?

:-suppose ek distrbuted system me 3 server hai,ek india me ek australia aur 
ek canada me , to teeno ka time different hoga

that's why we use lamport logical clock.

isme agar hmare pass 2 process hai p1 aur p2, isme har process
ke pass counter hota hai,jis pr event trigger hote rhta hai,

event nhi rhega to counter ko badha denge, agar event receive 
ho rha h to (maximum of event+1) kr denge
