What is a Caching?

:- Caching is a technique of storing frequently accessed or computed data in a temporary storage location called "cache".

:- This cache is typically faster to access than the 
original data source,eg. database,3rd party API etc.

:- 2 types of Caching-
(i)in-memory/local cache
(ii)Distributed cache

:-  It can be implemented using various technologies such 
as in-memory data stores (e.g., Redis, Memcached), local 
storage (e.g., browser cache), or content delivery
networks (CDNs).

:- Cache Hit: When the requested data is found in the cache, it's called a cache hit. This results in faster retrieval since the data is readily available in the cache.
:- Cache Miss: When the requested data is not found in the cache, it's called a cache miss. In this case, the system needs to retrieve the data from the original data source, which takes more time.


What is Cache Eviction Strategies?
:- 
Cache eviction strategies are mechanisms used to determine 
which items (data or resources) should be removed or 
replaced from a cache when the cache reaches its capacity 
limit.

some common cache eviction strategies are:
1. LRU:-This strategy evicts the least recently accessed item from the cache when the cache is full.
2. FIFO:-FIFO eviction strategy evicts the oldest item (the one that was first added to the cache) when the cache reaches its capacity limit.
3. LFU:-LFU eviction strategy evicts the least frequently accessed item from the cache when the cache is full.
4. MRU(Most recently Used):-
5. LIFO:-
6. RR(Random Replacement):-
