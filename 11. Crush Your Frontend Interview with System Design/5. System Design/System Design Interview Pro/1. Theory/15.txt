what is Consistency ?

:- when more than one client requests the system,for all such requests,
it will be called consistent when each client gets the same data.

:- the data should always be consistent,regardless of who is accessing it.

(suppose hum IRCTC se flight book kr rhe hai, jisme 2 seat khali hai
jisme se maine ek seat book kr ki,turant hi koi aur v usi seat ko book krta
hai mtlb data inconsistent hai).

2nd me jisne seat book kiya, use hum 'dirty read' bolte hai qki wo 
galat data read kr rha hai

Consistency in monolithic > Consistency in distributed
(qki monolithic me ek hi server hai to saare user isi me update 
krenge,lekin distributed me kisi v server se data change kr skte h)

Factors improving Consistency:-
1. Improving network bandwidth(network ki speed bdha do)
2. Stop the read(Jab tak sare server update na ho jaye,tab tak 
read ko stop kr dijiye)


Types of consistency:-
1. Strong Consistency:-
2. Eventual Consistency:-
3. Weak Consistency:-
