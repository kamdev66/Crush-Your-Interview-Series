what is Throughput and how to improve Throughput?

:- the volume of work or information flowing through a system
(hamara system per second me kitna work kr rha hai)

:- Throughput is the amount of data transmitted per unit of
time.
:- It is measured in bits per second. i.e. bps.

Throughput in monolithic < Throughput in Distributed
kyuki hum Distributed me aur v macine add kr skte hai ,jisse kaam 
fast krega

Causes of low Throughput:-
1. latency:- agar latency jyada hoga to throughput kam hoga
2. protocol overhead:- agar 2 server ke bich me handshake communication
ho rha h to usse latency badhegi,aur throughput kam hoga
3. congestion:- agar bahut jyada request aa rhi h to

How to improve throughput?
1. CDN
2. Caching
3. Distributed System
4. Load balancer
5. improve resources
