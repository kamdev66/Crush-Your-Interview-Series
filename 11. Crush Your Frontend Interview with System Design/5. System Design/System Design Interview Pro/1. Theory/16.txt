what is CDN (Content Delivery Network)?

:- CDN are geographically Distributed networks of proxy servers
and their objective is to serve content to users more quickly.

:- CDNs work by caching content (such as images, videos,
 stylesheets, JavaScript files, etc.) on multiple servers 
 located in various data centers across the globe.

eg:- When a user requests content from a website, the request 
first goes to the CDN's edge server, which is typically 
located closest to the user's geographical location. The 
edge server checks if it has the requested content in its
cache. If the content is cached on the edge server, it's
delivered directly to the user. If not, the edge server
retrieves the content from the origin server (the original 
source of the content), caches it locally,and then delivers 
it to the user.

Examples of popular CDNs include:
Cloudfare, Amazon CloudFront etc.

----------
website me 2 tarah ke content hote hai :-
1. static content(images,videos,css,js etc.)
2. dynamic content(changes according to user input)

CDN static content ko apne pass rkh ke website ko provide karta hai

CDN server user se jitna dur rhega website load hone utna hi time lega

(mtlb hame static content CDN se mil jayega aur dynamic content server 
se aayega)

CDN ke pass agar content nhi rhega to wo server se le lega aur
kuch time ke liye wo CDN server me hi store kr lega

Things to consider for using CDN ?
1. Cost:- jo content jyada use hone wala usi ko cdn me rkhenge,nhi to cost jyada aayega
2. Expiry time:- na jyada kam rkhenge ,na hi sabse jyada
