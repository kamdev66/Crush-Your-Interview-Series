Ques:- Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling?

Scalability:-
:- Scalability refers to the ability of a system, network, 
or process to handle growing amounts of traffic.

(Scalability ka mtlb hai agar traffic badh jaati hai to hmara 
system down hoga ya sahi rhega).

2 types:-

1. Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up):-we increase the capacity of existing hardware
 or software resources within a single server.we can upgrade 
 more powerful server with a faster CPU and more memory.

pros:-
1. easy implementation
2. less power(ek server h less power lgegi)
3. management is easy

cons:- 
1. single point of failure(spof)
2. limitation(ek limit tak hi badha skte hai)

2. Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out):-  we add more instances of servers,
databases, or other resources to distribute the workload 
across multiple nodes.
In a web application,for horizontal scalability, 
we used to deploy multiple servers behind a load balancer
to distribute incoming requests.

pros:-
1. not single point of failure
2. not limitation

cons:-
1. tough to secure(security tough ho jayegi).
2. management is hardware

QUes:- When to use horizontal and Vertical scaling?
Vertical Scaling:-
1. When traffic is low.
2. Simplicity is its advantage
Horizontal Scaling:-
1. For large scale applications
2. Huge traffic
