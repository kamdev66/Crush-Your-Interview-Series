Monolithic vs  MicroService:-

Architecture:- Internal design details for building the applications.


1. Monolithic Architecture:- iska mtlb wo architecture jiske andar
(frontend,backend,and data storage) teeno likhe gye ho aur 
deploy v saath me kiye gye ho.

:- If all the components and functionalities of a project are 
entangled and combined in a single codebase,is known as Monolithic
app.
:- monolithic architecture has less complexity
:- easier to understand
:- higher productivity
:- It is also known as centralised system.

Disadvantages :-
1. every module is combined in a single system,so if there is an error
or bugs in a single module,it can destroy the complete system.

2. whenever a single module is updated,whole system needs to be updated.


2. Distributed System:- A distributed system is a collection of
multiple individual system connected through a network that share
resources,communicate and coordinate to achieve common goals.

eg:- hmare pass 10gb ka storage hai usko hmne 5 jagah 2-2 gb krke 
store kr diya
suppose,ek machine khrab ho gya to hum baaki 4 ke kisi me se v data
le skte hai.

Advantages:-
1. Scalable
2. NO SPOF(single point of failure)
3. low latency(mtlb hum server ko kahi v rkh skte h,monolithic me ek server isliye ek jagah hi rkh skte the(high  latency))

Disadvantages:-
1.Complex 
2. management required
3. difficult to secure
