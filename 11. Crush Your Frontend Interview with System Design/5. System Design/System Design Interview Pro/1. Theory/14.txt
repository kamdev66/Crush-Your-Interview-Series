what is Availability?

:- 

Suppose, aaj hmara assignment submit krne ka last din hai,to saare
students aaj request krenge hmare college portal pr,jisse server
down ho jata hai,to hamre college portal ki Availability chli gyi

:- hame ye dekhna hai ki wo har situation me Available rhe

Availability= Total uptime/ + (Total downtime / Total uptime)Ã—100%
here,
Total uptime is the total amount of time that the system is operational and accessible.
Total downtime is the total amount of time that the system is unavailable or non-operational due to failures, maintenance, or other reasons.

Availability in monolithic < Availability in Distributed(bcoz of SPOF)

Fault tolerance is directly proportional to Availability

How to increase Availability?
1. Replication
2. Distributed System
3. redundancy

redundancy:- redundancy is the duplication of nodes,in case some of them are failing.
(suppose hmara ek component server pr deployed hai to hum us same server 
ko dusre server pr deploy kr dunga)

Replication:- includes redundancy  but synchronization of state between nodes.
(ye ek tarah ka redundancy hi hai lekin isme synchronization v rhta h(har node ek
dusre se synchronize rhte hai))

redundancy:-
1. Active redundancy:- is considered when each unit is operating /Active
and to the action.multiple nodes are connected to a load balancer,
and each unit receives an equal load.
(suppose amazon ke 3 server server hai aur teeno hmesa working
condition me rhega to usko hum active redundancy bolenge)

2. Passive redundancy:- is considered when one node is active or
operational and the other is not opearting.During the breakdown of 
active node,the passive node maintains Availability by becoming 
the active node
(suppose isme 2 server hai , jisme se ek working condition me hai,
aur ek nhi , lekin jab working condition wala server down ho jata
hai to uske bad saara request jo working condition me nhi tha uske
pass chla jayega aur ab wo work krne lgega)

Replication:- redundancy + synchronization
mtlb suppose hmare pass 1 database server hai usme kuch data store
hai ,bad me agar hum iska dupliaction (redundancy) krte hai to 
same data dusre server pr v hoga, lekin suppose iske baad hum ek 
database server pr kuch data insert krte hai to dusre pr v jaakr 
update krna hoga (isi ko hum synchronization bolte h).

simply,database ke liye hum Replication hi use krte h
