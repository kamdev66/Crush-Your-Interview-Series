what is latency in network ?

:- 
(agar hum amazon.com likhte hai , to ye request amazon ke server 
pr jayega,aur fir waha se response aayega. to jitna time laga is
round trip me ,usi ko latency bolte hai).

suppose,
t1-jaane me(req)
t2-aane me(res)
t3-backend computation (logic)

Latency=network delay+computational delay

:->> latency of monolithic < latency of Distributed

Note:- monolithic me network delay nhi hogi qki saare components
ek sath hai,isliye isme sirf(computational delay) hoga,
lekin Distributed me (network+computational delay) dono hoga qki
isme saare modules alag alag deployed honge isliye isme network calls
add ho jaati hai

How can we reduce latency?
1. Caching:- Caching is the process of storing information for a set period of time on a computer.
2. Use CDN
