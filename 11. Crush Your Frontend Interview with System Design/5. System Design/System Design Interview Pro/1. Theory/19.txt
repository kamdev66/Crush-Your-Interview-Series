19. What is Load Balancer?

:-Load Balancing is the process of efficient distribution of
network traffic across all nodes in a Distributed system.

:- agar koi user request kr rha hai to kis server pr wo request
jayegi wo load balancer decide krta hai

:- load balancer ke andar hum code likh dete hai ki kon si
request kis server pr jayegi


ROLES OF LOAD BALANCER:-
1. load distribution is equal over every node.
2. Health Check(if server is not operational,request is passed to another server)
3. Load balancer ensures high scalability,high throughput and high Availability.

NOTE:- In monolithic,we have only one server,so we dont need it.
In MicroService, we need load balancer.


Cons of Load Balancer:-
Single Point of Failure:-During a load balancer malfunctioning,
the communication between clients and servers would be broken.
To solve this issue,
we will use two load balancer :- one is active load balancer and another one is passive load balancer.
