25. what is synchronus communication and asynchronus communication?-(Engineering Digest)

:- synchronus communication(Blocking call):-
Aap is time kahi v nhi jaa skte hai jab tak ye complete na ho jaye

:-refers to a communication pattern where the sender of a 
message or function call waits for a response or completion
before proceeding with further execution. In other words, 
synchronous communication blocks the sender until the 
operation being performed is finished or a response is received.


:- High Consistency ke liye hum Synchronus communication ka use krte hai


ASYNCHRONUS COMMUNICATION:-
Asynchronous communication, also known as non-blocking 
communication, is a communication pattern where the sender
initiates an operation or message transmission without 
waiting for an immediate response or completion. Instead 
of blocking and waiting for the operation to finish, the 
sender continues its execution, and the response

where is it necessary:-
1. computation takes a lot of time
2. Scalability of applications
3. avoid cascading failure
