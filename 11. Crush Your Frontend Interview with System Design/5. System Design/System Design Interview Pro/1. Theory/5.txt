What is HTTP?

:- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's a 
fundamental protocol used for transferring data on the 
World Wide Web. 

In simpler terms, it's the set of rules 
that allow web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)
and web servers (computers that store and deliver web pages) 
to communicate with each other.

(ye ek req-res protocol hai,jiske through client aur server ek dusre se communicate kr paate hai)
