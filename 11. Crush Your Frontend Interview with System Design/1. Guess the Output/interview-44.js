// accept any number of arguments, which will be concatenated together and output to 
// the console.

// It works the same way as console.log, but it typically displays the output in red 
// to indicate an error.

// It works the same way as console.log, but it typically displays the output in 
// yellow to indicate a warning.

// console. It works the same way as console.log, but it typically displays the 
// output in blue to indicate an informational message.

// level in dev tools in the dropdown


//6. console.table: This method is used to output data in a tabular format in the 
// console. It takes an object or an array as an argument and displays the contents 
// in a table with columns and rows.
