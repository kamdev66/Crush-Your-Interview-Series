------------------Async Iterators/Generators-------------------

:- asyncIterator is about iteratingthrough the data which is coming asynchronusly or in chunks on demand instead of getting it together.
:-It means we can use 'for await...of' loop instead of 'for...of' loop.




ques:- what is Symbol.asyncIterator?
:- Symbol.asyncIterator is a way to implement iterator with about asynchronus process.

Ques:- Can we use spread operator with async iteratr e.g.[...obj]?
:- It is not possible bcoz the spread operator is going to return an array.The array is returned when the values are retrived.
:- whereas in asynchronus process,the data is retrieved in small chunks and then it gathers.
