-------------Explain must know points of Arrow functions-----------------------

1. "This" object does not work with arrow function.
2. "arguments" object does not work with arrow function.
3. we can't use "new" to call arrow function.


IIFE:- A function which calls itself,is called Immediately invoked function expression.
(
 function(){
    console.log("IIFE");    //IIFE
  }
)()

IIAF:- A function which calls itself using arrow function,is called Immediately invoked Arrow function .
(()=>{
    console.log("IIAF");    //IIAF
  }
)()


:- why "this" does not work in arrow function?
:- we already have a class keyword to deal with the classes.
:- we don't need function to act as a class.
