1. Difference betweeen "null" and Undefined?
:-Most of the languages have data types variables.
->Javascript also has but at th time of variable declaration,there is no type decided.
->After the value assigned to the variable,it decides the data type.
->So before any value is assigned to a variable in Javascript,it contains "undefined".
let x;  //Undefined
let x=9;  //number

--->typeof is a kind of operator,that gives you  the data type of a variable.
-->undefined is a data type in Javascript.

NUll:- null means nothing.When we have a variable or object which we want to make empty,then we assign "null" toa variable.
let x=null;
let y;
console.log(x==y)  //true
Bcoz both undefined and null represents nothing.
console.log(x===y)// false

Note:- undefined itself is a data type,"null" is a primitive data type.
Ques:- can you explicitly assign "undefined" to a variable?
:- Yes,we can.
let x=undefined;
console.log(x);  //undefined
