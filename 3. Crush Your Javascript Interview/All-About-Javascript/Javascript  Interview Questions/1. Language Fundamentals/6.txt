--------When do you get NaN as output---------------
:- NaN is  a global property representing "Not-a-Number".
:- we normally get this error when there is a non numeric value or operation performed.

:- isNaN() is a function which returns true or false depending on the expression.

let a=5;
let b="value";
console.log(a*b)  //NaN


let a=5;
let b="value";
console.log(isNaN(a*b))  //true


console.log(NaN==NaN)   //false
console.log(NaN===NaN)   //false


what is the difference between isNaN() and isFinite() method?
:- isNaN() checks whether the value is Not-A-Number or not.
:- isFinite() checks for NaN as well as infinity values.
