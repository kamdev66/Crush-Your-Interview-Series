----------------What is Automatic Semicolon Insertion?--------------
:-You must have used ";" many times in javascript code.
:-Almost all lines are terminated by ";"
:-If you forgot to write ";",then also javascript will not show any error.
:- The Reason for not showing error is that,the compiler Automatically adds a Semicolon at the end of those lines.
This feature is called ASI(Automatic Semicolon Insertion).
