:- Web storage api is used by developer to store the data into the web browser.
:- this data is nothing but key value pair of strings.

There are two mechanism to store the data;-
1. Session storage
2. Local storage

When i say, the data is stored in session storage,that means the data is persisted only for particular session.

It is very useful than cookies,Unlike cookies session storage data is not being sent to the server while making the network request.
Session storage has larger capacity to hold the data.[min. 5 mb data we can store]

In cookies, we can store only 4000 bytes of data.

local storage is same as session storage but it not clears the data itself.It has higher capacity to store the data than session.
here, capacity depends on what type of device you are using, what type of Browser you are using.

Due to security reasons,they follow same origin policy.
