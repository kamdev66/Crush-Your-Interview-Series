--------------what is event bubbling and event capturing--------------------------------

:- event.target returns the reference of element which raised the event.
:-The default path of Event propagation is bottom to top.

:- Event Bubbling:- A bubble has a tendency to go up from the bottom,that's why we say it as "Event Bubbling".

:- In Case if you want to stop the default propagation i.e. bottom to top, we can use event.stopPropagation().

:- Event Capturing:- In case if we want to change this default propagation path, and we make it top to bottom , is called "Event Capturing".

:- for capture phase, we have to use addEventListener() method to bind the event.
:- Capturing phase means top to bottom.

:- There are few events which do not get propagated like focus event.
