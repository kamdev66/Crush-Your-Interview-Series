--------------Function Scope vs Block Scope--------------------
What is scope of a variable?
:- Scope of a variable is the lifetime or avialabilty of a variable.
:- Scope of a variable can be local or global.

function a(){
let x=10;     //here variable x is local to function a() 
}
function b(){
console.log(x);   //gives reference error
}
a()
b();


let x=10;  //global variable
function a(){
x=x+5;
}
function b(){
console.log(x); //15
}
a();
b();

:- Hoisting means bringing the declaration on top.
Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted but, unlike var , are not initialized with a default value. An exception will be thrown if a variable declared with let or const is read before it is initialized.

:- Block scope is nothing but the brackets{}.
