-------------------Memory management and Garbage Collection----------------
:-when you declare a variable,object,array, or function all are stored somewhere inthe memory.
:-when program ends,the data inside location is Garbage which needs to be cleared.
:- making the memory free is the process of "Garbage Collection" & there is a routine who does it,called Garbage Collector.
:- Mark-and-Sweep algorithm will look for unmarked locations & will clean them.
:-  Mark-and-Sweep algorithm is used for Garbage Collection
:-  Mark-and-Sweep algorithm will start from the "Global" object & it marks the referenced values & unreachable locations are cleared.
