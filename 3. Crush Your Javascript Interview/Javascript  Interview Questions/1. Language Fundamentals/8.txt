--------How does a closure work in javascript?--------
:- when function comes under another function , a "closure" is created.

function outer(){
  function inner(){
    console.log("Inner called"); //ReferenceError: inner is not defined,bcoz scope for inner function is inside the outer function.
  }
}
inner()


1st method:-
function outer(){
  function inner(){
    console.log("Inner called"); // Inner called
  }
  inner()
}
outer()

2nd method:- 
function outer(){
  function inner(){
    console.log("Inner called"); // Inner called
  }
  return inner;
}
const cl=outer();
cl() 
console.log(cl)   //Æ’ inner()


:- Closure is useful when you want to make few private members available globally when needed.
