//Explain Event propagation:-

//:---
// DOM event propagation is the process by which events are passed through the elements 
// in the Document Object Model (DOM) tree. It determines the order in which elements 
// receive and respond to events. There are two types of event propagation in the DOM: 
// event bubbling and event capturing.
