// Explanation:-
// const value=Math.random()*500+500;
//this line generates a random number between 500 and 1000 using Math.random(), which 
//returns a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). 
// This random number is then multiplied by 500, so it falls in the range between 
// 0 (inclusive) and 500 (exclusive), and then 500 is added to shift the range 
// to be between 500 (inclusive) and 1000 (exclusive). 


// const value2=Math.random()*500;
// this line generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) 
// using Math.random(), multiplies it by 500 to shift the range to be between 0 
// (inclusive) and 500 (exclusive), and assigns the resulting value to the 
// variable value2.
