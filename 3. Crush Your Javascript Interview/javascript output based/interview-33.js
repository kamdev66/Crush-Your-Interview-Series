// GUESS THE OUTPUT??

console.log(1+"2"+3); //'123'
// NOTE:- When the string "2" is concatenated with the number 1, it becomes a string "12". Then, when the number 3 is concatenated with this string, it results in the final string "123".

console.log("1"+2+3); //'123'

console.log(1+2+'3'); //'33'
//NOTE:- The expression 1 + 2 evaluates to 3, which is then concatenated with the string "3" to form the final string "33".

console.log('1'+2-3); //9
//NOTE:- The expression '1' + 2 results in the string "12". But since the next operator is -, JavaScript will attempt to convert the string "12" to a number. The result of the expression '12' - 3 will be the number 9.
