Redux:-
:-Redux is a state management tool for javascript frameworks like react and angular.
:-The main purpose of redux is control one component data from another component using reducers,acions.


1st Step:- we have to create a separate file for our data which is called as reducer.
so,whatever the data which is related to cart values ,we have to put in cartReducer.js.
eg:- const initialData={
    cartcount:0
}
and we can access this data in navbar.js and items.js by exporting cartReducer.js.

:- to create the reducer , we have to create the function.
In this function ,we have to give 2 parameters:- 1. data  2. action
:-action means nothing but function which are used to change the cart count.

NOTE:- i will import cartReducer function in app.js bcoz it is the parent of all child component.so, it will import automatically in every child component.


now,we have to create the store.
Store is nothing but the data where our reducer is present.

NOTE:-- To tell the react-compiler that cartReducer.js is our store,we have to install redux and react-redux.

Now for creating store,
first we have to import the createStore module from the redux.

now,to provide the data for specific component,we have to import "Provider" from react-redux.

NOTE:-
To access the data from any reducers or store,we have to import useSelector from react-redux.

now,we have to create the action .


NOTE:- To call the function in the reducer files,we have to import usedispatch .

Let's RECAP ALL this CONCEP till here:-
:- 1st step is creating the reducer file,reducer file is nothing but where we put all our data and the functions which are used to changed the data.
:- In that reducer file,we have to create two things:- 1st thing is initial data that means before calling the function,which data you want to show on the scren.
2nd thing is function,this function will accept two parameters:- state=initialData and action.
:- action is nothing but the function in redux terminologies

Now,we will make a store.
we need to wrap our child component under Provider.we have to tell the provider that what name of our store is.

:- To get the data from the store or reducers,we use hook called useSelector.
:- To call the functions which are present in the reducer file,we use hook called useDispatch.
