:- Higher Order Component is a pattern where a function takes a component as an argument and returns a new Component.
It looks like this:-
const NewComponent=higherOrderComponent(originalComponent)
const EnhancedComponent=higherOrderComponent(originalComponent)


Why we use Higher Order Components?
:- To share common functionality between components.
