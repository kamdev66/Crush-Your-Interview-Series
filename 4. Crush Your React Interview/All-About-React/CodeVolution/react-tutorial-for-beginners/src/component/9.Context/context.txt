:- Context Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

:-There are 3 steps of using Context:-
1. Create the Context:- create a new file.within the file ,we will use createContext() method from react to create the user context.
   :- every context object created using the create context method comes with a Provider and a Consumer


import React from "react";
const UserContext=React.createContext()
const UserProvider=UserContext.Provider
const UserConsumer=UserContext.Consumer
export {UserConsumer,UserProvider}


2. Provide a Context value:-The place where we provide is important because only the descendant component can use it.
In our program,best place is Starting component(Jo sbka ancestor hai)
:- The way we provide value by using "value" attribute on the Provider component.
e.g:- <UserProvider value="Kamdev">
        <ComponentA/>
        </UserProvider>


3. Consume the Context value:- Now,we need to consume the "value" in desired Component.
:- To consume the value , we need Consumer Component.
:- we need to start with curly braces and include an arrow function,The function gets the UserContext value .
<UserConsumer>
            {
                (username)=>{
                    return <h2>Hello {username}</h2>
                }
            }
</UserConsumer>


Note:- we can set default value to the context. like:- const UserContext=React.createContext("DSA n DEV") ->jeb ye krenge to UserProvider ko remove krna padega
