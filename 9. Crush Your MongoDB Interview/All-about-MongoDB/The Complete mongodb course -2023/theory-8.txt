Introduction to Aggregation Framework:- 

:-Mongo Query Language(MQL) is sufficient for simple queries.
But,
The aggregation Framework allows for more advanced operations.

:-Pipelines in Aggregation Framework:-
These pipelines are considered to be operations or stages:-
Each stages perform a different operation.
$match stage -> $project stage -> $group stage

NOTE:- The Aggregation Framework also allows for a single stage to be used or many stages.

SYNTAX:-
db.collection.aggregate([{stage 1},{stage 2},...{stage N}],{options})
