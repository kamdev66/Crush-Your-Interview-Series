Replica Sets and Clusters:-

:- Replica sets consist of 3 machines.
There are 3 'instances' in a replica set and each 'instance' contains a full copy
of the data in each instance.

:- A sharded Cluster contains a group of replica sets.
Sharded cluster contains:-
1. Shard - containing a partition of data
2. Mongos - interface between any application using mongodb and the sharded cluster.
3. Config servers- store metadeta and configure settings.

Suppose,you have a very large collection consisting of many many documents.mongodb 
uses a shard key to distribute this collection across the shards.

//jab large collection of data rhega to hum shard key ki help se isko small small 
shard me distribute kr skte hai.

Benefits of sharded Cluster:-
fault tolerance:- 
scalability:-by sharding the data we can increase the storage capacity
move data closer to users(eg:- we can deploy  cluster to america or any place as well)

NOTE:-
Fault tolerance in MongoDB refers to the ability of the database system to 
continue operating in the event of a failure, such as a hardware or network 
outage, software error, or other unforeseen issue.
MongoDB provides fault tolerance by using a distributed architecture 
that enables replication and automatic failover. The system can replicate 
data across multiple servers, called replicasets, so that if one server fails, 
the remaining replicas can continue serving the application.
